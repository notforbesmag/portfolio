				<p>I’m Soudea (pronounced Sowd-ay), a reformed anthropology major interested in understanding why people do what they do when using technology and how to create better experiences for them. My journey into user experience was inspired by my grandmother purchasing her first tablet and all the ‘Aha!’ moments that came with it.</p>
				<p>I like thinking about mobile devices, reading HCI papers, and doubletapping on Instagram.</p>

						<h4><b>Chicago</b></br>Information Design, Web Development</h4>
						<p>As part of Pratt's Web Mapping course, I created a website highlighting homicide in Chicago. I used Leaflet and d3.js to create information visualizations.</p>

						<h4><b>Pink Passenger Transportation</b></br>User Research and App Design</h4>
						<p>I did a user flow design for a transportation company app. After conducting field research by riding with potential users for hours, I organized their expectations for the app, sketching out different layouts for each screen, and then creating a mockup in Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator and animating user actions in Adobe AfterEffects.</p>
						<p>This simulates a user checking the transportation route and then buying and using a ticket.</p>

						<h4><b>The Kullberg Foundation</b></br>Web Design and Development</h4>
						<p>This was an exciting venture into the world of web design and an opportunity to experience working with a client, creating a website from scratch, and designing user experience solutions for particular context.</p> 
						<p>My favorite aspect of the website is the audio solution. The client really wanted to have background music so I had to figure out how to integrate the music while still making the website user-friendly. This resulted in ditching the standard HTML5 player and creating a toggle function to control the music.</p>
