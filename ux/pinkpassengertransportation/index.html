    <h3>Pink Passenger Transportation</h3>
    <h4>UX Research &amp; Design</h4>
    <p>The Pink Passenger Transportation app was created as an exercise in understanding Brooklyn commuter van riders. This was originally developed as part of research into the creation of a new commuter van route for a new demographic. I spent several hours riding with and interviewing passengers to understand what technology they used and how I could improve the pick-up and payment experiences of commuters. User interviews identified these needs and desires:</p>

    <p>With the user needs in mind, I started to wireframe designs for the app. My wireframing process starts with sketches and develops into Photoshop or Illustrator documents.</p>

    <p>Next comes a detailed mockup. Visual identity is applied, features are finalized, and the interface is refined. By this point, design choices should be justified for both business and user needs.</p>

    <p>The design process doesn't end with mockups. It is becoming increasingly important to be able to understand movement and navigation in a touchscreen world. I animated a user flow to demonstrate movement within the app. When communicating with developers, being able to show exactly how transitions should be implemented saves times in production and revision.</p>
